# go-pagination

### Description
This is a small project to test out pagination with Gin Framework and Gorm ORM for Golang. I used 2 methods for doing the pagination query :
- Offset Method
- Seek Method

With a quick and not detailed test from seeing Gin's logs, the seek method is much faster for pagination but definitely needs more effort to implement
